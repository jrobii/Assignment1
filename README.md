# GitHub Repository
A Github repository was used to ensure that code could be versioned and stored somewhere else rather than locally.
The repository was kept clean and was regularly committed to when new code was implemented that was working. The repository holds code for the angular and server (node) services.

# Data Structure
### Back-End
Data on the back end is stored in serialised JSON files. One called users.json that holds the user information and gcd.json that stores the groups and channel data. Each json file is essentially a big array as that was the most efficient way to store and fetch multiple users and groups respetively.

**users.json**
- id - a unique number that identifies each user.
- username - the users username.
- email - the email for the user.
- password - the password for authentication.
- role - the role of the user.

**gcd.json**
- id - a unique number that identifies the group.
- name - the name of the group.
- admins - an array of user id's that are admins of the group.
- assis - an array of user id's that are assistants of the group.
- users - an array of user id's that have access to the group.
- channels - an array of channel objects that belong to this group.
> name - name of the channel.
> users - array of users that can access the channel.

### Front-End
Data is fetched from the back-end through HTTP Post Requests. Data is also sent to the back-end through objects containing the relevant data.
The data for the front-end recieved from the back end is stored in local variables such as arrays to hold the group/user data or simple variables that are used to 2-way bind forms to grab entered information.
The logged in users information is stored in local storage of the browser and is cleared when they log out.

# Angular Architecture

### Components
**Admin Component**
In the admin component this is used for the user administration. It holds the forms that allow for adding and deleting a user, adding and remvoving a user from a group and adding and removing users from channels within groups. Only s-admins, g-admins and group assis can access this component.

**Channel Admin Component**
In the channel admin component this is used for administration of the channls. This contains the forms and functions that are used to add and remove channels.

**Chat Component**
This is the main page of the chat app. So far this only contains the list of the groups and channels the user has been added to.

**Group Admin Component**
The Group Admin component handles the administration of the groups. It has the forms and functions for adding and removing a group, adding and removing group admins and adding and removing group assistants.

**Login Component**
Handles the authentication of users and shows the login form to the user.

### Services
Services have been used because they add a level of reusability into the code. The requests can be made from the components, but I decided to split them up so i can see different aspects of my project better and to clear up my code.

**Channel Service**
The channel service is the service that handles the post requests for the channel related functions and returning of the respective data.

**Group Service**
The group service is the service that handles the post requests for the group related functions and returning of the respective data.

**Login Service**
The login service is the service that handles the authentication of the user.

**User Service** 
The user service handles the the post requests for the user related functionality and also returns the respective data.

### Models
**User Model**
The User model has been created so that we can define what a user should be and this makes it easier when handling a user.
